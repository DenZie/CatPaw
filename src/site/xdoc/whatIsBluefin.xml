            <p>
                This project is where open-source meets automation. 
                Bluefin wires together open-source technologies such as Selenium, TestNG, and Maven to create a powerful open test framework. 
                <u>Bluefin is not a programming language, it does not dictate how you should execute your test, nor does it control how to verify your test cases are successful</u>.
                 Bluefin simply provides some Java APIs (methods/functions) which you can use within your test case to perform browser specific actions.
